Homework - Week 2 - VBA and Excel

I have included two files:

1. Results_Homework_Week2 (both .docx and .pdf extensions). It includes screenshots of the three years of stocks reported. Results match for 2015. Results included for the "Hard" option. Challenge option also completed (see VBA file).

2. Module1.bas file includes an extract of the VBA code. There are two sub definitions:

AllWorksheetsLoop(): Loops through all worksheets in the workbook and calls the StockSummary to complete the Stock Summary calculations.

Sub StockSummary(): Using the same logic as the loop loop credit card loop complete the "Easy" section. Create another loop to go over the results and produce the second set of results ("Hard".
